			Today I'm going to begin the inclusion of a .css page. This div has an id while the rest have the same class. 
			<p>I also want to begin partitioning the website using these id's and classes, so I'm using colors to differentiate and begin setting this up.</p>
			<p>I learned a bit of the basics of website design in Indianapolis. One of the coolest things I learned so far was that if you use margin:0 in a body tag in css, it helps so that there's no extra space from the top of the page and the first div.</p>

				Potential box

			<div class = 'sideImage'>Goal is to move this to the right of "Potential box"

		<div id='helpSources'>
			I'm adding in a new div specifically for sources that I use to help understand/learn more. At the moment, these are being added in as paragraphs.
