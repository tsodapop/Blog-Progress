		So for my tabs, my next thing that I want them to do is to be able to produce different results within the same space. I think I will want to use some javascript for that and since I didn't prepare any for today, I'm just going to work on some other aspects regarding the tabs.<br><br> today was overall a little bit of style testing on the tabs and making it so that they change colors for hovering. Overall, making sure that I knew how to use double pseudos as well as seeing if I could play with the colors to what I would like. Not sold on the colors, but at least I did learn that you need to have it as x:hover::pseudo<br><br> tomorrow will be some basic attempts at javascript.
