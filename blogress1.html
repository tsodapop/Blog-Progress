		OKAY this took me way longer than it should have. I was making the bottom right homebutton work so that it would pull it up but I kept thinking there was an interaciton issue between that button and the link two button. I tried several instances to see why the button itself was not working. <br><br> What I had to do in the end to fix this was to hide everything else and test tabTwo in the new made function. when that didn't work, I realized the main difference between the top and bottom functions was that I was missing a parantheses ) symbol. This fixed everything. Now, both buttons work. WHEW. okay.
