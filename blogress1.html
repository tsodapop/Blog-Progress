			I made the realization that I should definitely be able to make distinct divs inside divs not be related to each other. Because of this, the Potential box and the orange box need to be independent of each other. I wanted to really emphasize this because I want to be able to make buttons and align them with other side by side divs without having to rely on each other. I spent these 30 minutes working on this with the current set up that I have now, but I think it is a little overbearing for someone on my level. I'll be simplifying this into div sets so I can practice this on day 5.

			I'm adding in a new div specifically for sources that I use to help understand/learn more. At the moment, these are being added in as paragraphs.
