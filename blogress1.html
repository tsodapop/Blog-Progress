			This is going to be the start of my 30 day project website. 
		</div>
		<div class='introPara'>
			I'll be spending 30 minutes a day working on learning a new aspect of web design and trying to apply it to this website.
		</div>
		<div class='introPara'>
			Today, I'm just working on setting up the basics of the whole thing and playing around with divs. Every new sentence here is a new div. 
		</div>
		<div class='introPara'>
			I'm also working on creating and differentiating the power of id's vs. classes. I'm also trying to understand if its better or worse to indent with 2 or 4 spaces. 
		</div>
		<div class='introPara'>
			Everything I write will be updated on github! That's it for day!
