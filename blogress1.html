			30 Days of 30 Minutes

		So I think a really big problem with how I've been studying is that I get really excited about certain ideas and topics - and as I work on it, I find another interesting topic and want to work on that. <br><br> I think it's really awesome that everything is so cool and interesting, but it's hard to keep my head in focus. <br><br> To sort of push myself to be more tactful with learning, I'm going to work on making goals and setting those goals to have an overarching end goal. <br><br> That being said, I do want to finish up these 30 days first before moving on. I think it's better to use the remaining days as a knowledge base for future work.<br><br> Today was about working with buttons and seeing what else they can do. For now, I've got toggle() and fadeIn/FadeOut which I think are really cool. I want to see how to click somethign to create a dropdown of sorts, and if I click out of the dropdown, it will close off instead of having to click something before closing. That's the goal for tomorrow. I also want to work on if/then statements.
