			30 Days of 30 Minutes

		<div id='Introduction'>
		Being day 30, I wanted to do a little bit of reflection because if I started on learning something new and I got stuck, I would get frustrated. <br><br> I think a lot of the things that I worked on throughout these 30 days was a good mixture of new things as well as old things that I was slightly exposed to before. Practical application definitely makes a difference because I am forced to troubleshoot it if I don't have the solution right away and I can learn more about what means what through that as well. <br><br> I was also able to note that some weaknesses of mine are that I lose focus easily without a goal in mind and that being active every day might not be a possibility. I think two fix both of these, the best next method would be to tackle an actual project and not force myself into doing work if I don't want to (I don't want to feel obligated, I want to want it). With that in mind, I will be actively trying to work on more things as much as possible, but I won't try to make myself feel guilty if I have to miss a day for any reason. <br><br> I'm not sure if I'll be specifically doing another 30 days for a project or if it would be better to just focus on completing a project without a timeline. I'll be deciding that when I start my first project.<br><br> I am glad that I did work on this and I learned a lot.
