			I spent the majority of today's 30 minutes on figuring out how to move the position of the right div next to the "Potential Box" divs. I decided to use inline-block. Interesting to note that the second div will begin its appointed height to where the bottom of the first div is. I removed the other "Potential Box" divs as a result, as I really want to get formatting down before details.
			<p> I have also found out how to put divs next to each other without having a space in between them - you have to comment out the space between the html in the divs. I will have to defer to this option until I can see if there's a better option at making divs sit next to each other. </p>

			I'm adding in a new div specifically for sources that I use to help understand/learn more. At the moment, these are being added in as paragraphs.
