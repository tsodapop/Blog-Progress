		Something Interesting that I learned in this 30 minutes is that with divs, it looks like if you add put two empty divs next to each other (like TEXT ONE and TEXT TWO) but only have text in one of the divs, it will move one of the divs to the bottom of the first div. Example here: https://jsfiddle.net/p11uzk58/ <br>Because of this, I will be continuing to add on to the current board, BUT I have decided that I will be creating a section for questions that I want to continue to look answers up for. This will be one of them.<br> My next goal now that I have finally figured out how to set these up in tandem is to include a button on one side and an image on another.

			I'm adding in a new div specifically for sources that I use to help understand/learn more. At the moment, these are being added in as paragraphs.
