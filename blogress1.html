		Today's the last day I work on basic button effects. I wanted to add a transitioning effect just to see how it works. I also have a general lay out I want to make this website! So I'm going to start implementing some of the things I learned so far into making that happen. <br><br>
		To make sure I remember, I want to have a large overview on top with sectionss cut out by tabs on the bottom. Ideally, each clicking on a tab will change the information shown below it.

			I'm adding in a new div specifically for sources that I use to help understand/learn more. At the moment, these are being added in as paragraphs.
